## Personal Note from Brandon

This was a great learning experience. I was following a tutorial for creating this project, however when the tutorial was outdated. To port this project into using the newest version of GraphQL and Apollo took a tremendous amount of time in the documentation learning the finer inter-workings of everything I was working with.
